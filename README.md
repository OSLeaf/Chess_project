# Chess_project

This is ongoing project to train a neural network to play chess. End goal will be beating me in one on one, but it still has a assortment of bugs to be fixed. 

This project is continuation of lessons learned from the book "Neural Networks for Chess, The magic of deep and reinforcement learning revealed" by Dominik Klein. His github page for the book: http://github.com/asdfjkl/neural_network_chess

My implementation of Hexapawn engine from the book can be found from the hexapawn folder.
